    "body": "<p>You've landed. The taxi from the airport cost somewhere between 70 and 200 dirhams depending on how good your negotiation face is. You're inside the medina now, or near it, and you need to eat.</p>\n\n<p>Here's what to know before you walk into anywhere.</p>\n\n<h2>The rules</h2>\n\n<p><strong>Bread is your utensil.</strong> Every meal comes with khobz — round, dense, golden bread. Tear pieces, use them to scoop. There will not always be a fork.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Eat with your right hand.</strong> If you're eating from a shared dish (and you will be), use your right hand. Left hand stays off the communal plate.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Water comes in bottles.</strong> Don't drink the tap water. A 1.5L bottle of Sidi Ali costs 5–8 dirhams everywhere.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Prices are not always on the wall.</strong> At street stalls, ask before you order. “Bshhal?” means “how much?” Knowing this word saves you money.</p>\n\n<h2>Your first meal: play it safe</h2>\n\n<p>If you want air conditioning, a menu in English, and a gentle introduction, go to <strong>Café des Épices</strong> in the spice square. It's not the most authentic meal in the city, but the rooftop is calm, the avocado smoothie is cold, and you can watch the square below while you adjust to the noise. Tagines run 60–90 MAD. It's a landing pad, not a destination.</p>\n\n<h2>Your first real meal: go to the lamb</h2>\n\n<p>Walk to <strong>Mechoui Alley</strong>, a row of stalls just off Jemaa el-Fna near the Koutoubia side. This is where whole lambs roast underground for hours. There's no menu. You point at the lamb, they pull meat off the bone with their hands, weigh it, and serve it on paper with bread, cumin, and salt. Half a kilo is enough for one person (40–60 MAD). The meat is so tender it falls apart when you look at it.</p>\n\n<p>This is the meal that will recalibrate your expectations for the rest of the trip.</p>\n\n<h2>The sandwich that costs 15 dirhams</h2>\n\n<p>Marrakech has a street sandwich culture that nobody writes about. At any hole-in-the-wall with a charcoal grill, you can get a <strong>kefta sandwich</strong> — spiced minced beef, grilled over coals, stuffed into a roll with tomato, onion, and harissa. Fifteen dirhams. Sometimes twenty. It's the best value meal in the city.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Haj Mustapha</strong> near Bab Fteuh usually has a queue. That's your quality signal.</p>\n\n<h2>The tangia question</h2>\n\n<p>Tangia is Marrakech's other dish — the one tourists don't know about. Beef or lamb sealed in a clay urn and slow-cooked in the ashes of a hammam furnace. It takes 6–8 hours. You can't rush it. <strong>Snack Chez Brahim</strong> near the tanneries is a good starting point, though the neighbourhood is harder to find.</p>\n\n<p>You'll read more about tangia in our story on the dish. For now, just know it exists and it's better than most tagines you'll eat this week.</p>\n\n<h2>If you're in Gueliz</h2>\n\n<p>The new town isn't where most tourists eat, but <strong>Amal Women's Training Centre</strong> is worth the walk. It's a non-profit that trains disadvantaged women in restaurant skills. The daily tagine (60–90 MAD) changes every day and is consistently excellent. The space is calm, the service is warm, and your money goes somewhere good.</p>\n\n<h2>What not to do</h2>\n\n<p>Don't eat at a restaurant because a man in the street tells you to follow him there. He gets a commission. The food will be mediocre and overpriced.</p>\n\n<p>Don't order from a menu with photos of every dish laminated in plastic. That's tourist infrastructure, not a kitchen.</p>\n\n<p>Don't eat at the stalls in the centre of Jemaa el-Fna on your first night. Save that for when you've got your bearings. We have a full guide to the square.</p>",

    "body": "<p>A Moroccan breakfast arrives all at once. No courses, no order. Everything lands on the table in small dishes and you're expected to know what to do with it.</p>\n\n<p>Here's what you're looking at.</p>\n\n<h2>The breads</h2>\n\n<p>There will be at least two, probably three.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Khobz</strong> — the round, golden, slightly dense bread you'll eat at every meal. Tear it, don't cut it. This is your spoon, your fork, and your plate.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Msemen</strong> — square, flaky, layered flatbread. Think of it as a Moroccan croissant, except it's cooked on a griddle and served with honey or soft cheese. The best msemen are crispy outside and almost translucent inside.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Baghrir</strong> — the thousand-hole pancakes. Spongy, cratered on one side, smooth on the other. They're made from semolina batter and the holes form naturally as the batter cooks. You pour honey or melted butter into the holes.</p>\n\n<p>Some riads will also serve <strong>harcha</strong> — a dense, crumbly semolina bread that tastes like a savoury scone.</p>\n\n<h2>The spreads</h2>\n\n<p><strong>Amlou</strong> — this is the one you've never heard of. Ground almonds, argan oil, and honey blended into a thick paste. It's sometimes called “Amazigh Nutella” and it's better than anything in a jar. Spread it on msemen.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Olive oil</strong> — usually a small dish of local olive oil for dipping bread.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Honey</strong> — often orange blossom or thyme. Drizzle it on everything.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Soft cheese (jben)</strong> — fresh, white, mild. Similar to ricotta. Sometimes mixed with herbs.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Butter</strong> — often smen (aged, fermented butter) at traditional places, or plain butter at riads that cater to international guests.</p>\n\n<h2>The extras</h2>\n\n<p><strong>Olives</strong> — green and black, always present, sometimes marinated.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Eggs</strong> — usually hardboiled or scrambled with tomatoes and spices (a variation of shakshuka).</p>\n\n<p><strong>Bissara</strong> — in Fez, breakfast might include this dried fava bean soup drizzled with olive oil and cumin. It costs 5 dirhams at street stalls.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Fruit</strong> — orange juice (freshly squeezed, always), sometimes seasonal fruit.</p>\n\n<h2>The tea</h2>\n\n<p>Mint tea arrives at the end or throughout. It's green tea (Chinese gunpowder) with fresh mint and sugar. A lot of sugar. Refusing the sugar is fine but unusual. The tea is part of the meal — not a beverage, a ritual.</p>\n\n<h2>What to do</h2>\n\n<p>Take a bit of everything. Alternate sweet and savoury. Dip the msemen in amlou. Pour honey into the baghrir holes. Eat the olives between bites of bread and cheese. There's no wrong order.</p>\n\n<p>The meal is meant to last. Nobody is rushing you.</p>",
